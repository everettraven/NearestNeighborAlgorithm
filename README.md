# NearestNeighborAlgorithm
This is an implementation of the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm taught in my Discrete Mathematics class at Florida Polytechnic University.

It will use the Google Directions API to find the optimal path to take you the places you want to go. It will even optimize based on traffic patterns.


# Currently Implemented:
    1. Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
# Need to implement:
    1. Google Directions API to get travel times with traffic
    2. Ability to enter places a person is going
